### What is CRM design?

CRM design is the process of creating an intuitive UX for CRM software, optimizing user workflows, data interaction, and ensuring alignment with business goals for improved efficiency and user satisfaction.

### Which CRM components should come first?

Start designing the components users will interact with daily—data tables, record forms, the main dashboard, navigation, and filters.

### Do I need my own DS if I use Salesforce/Dynamics?

Yes. Custom design systems offer more than basic tools—they keep your brand consistent and create a better experience for your users and changing business needs.

### How do I design dedupe/merge flows without data loss?

Use clear previews of the final record, design progressive disclosure of options, and create a robust undo function combined with a clear audit trail.

### What are CRM dashboard best practices?

Some of the best practices include focusing on role-specific KPIs, enabling drill-through navigation to underlying data, and providing easy, real-time, and scheduled reporting options.
