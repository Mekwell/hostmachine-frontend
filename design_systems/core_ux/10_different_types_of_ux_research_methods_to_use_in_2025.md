### What are the primary categories of UX research?

The primary categories of UX research are qualitative (for instance, user interviews, contextual inquiry) and quantitative (for example, surveys, A/B testing). The methodologies can also be classified as generative (to explore needs) or evaluative (to test solutions).

### How to pick the right UX research method?

To pick the right UX method, define your goals (discover vs. validate, behavioral vs. attitudinal), then match methods accordingly and consider time, budget, and team resources.

### A/B testing - qualitative or quantitative?

A/B testing is quantitative. This is because, in A/B testing, measurable outcomes (like clicks or conversions) between design variations are compared. Statistical analysis is used for the same.

### How does usability testing differ from user testing?

While both involve observing users as they attempt to complete predefined tasks in a digital product, user testing’s scope is much wider. In fact, usability testing falls under the umbrella of user testing, which also involves methods like user interviews, card sorting, diary studies, contextual inquiries, etc.
