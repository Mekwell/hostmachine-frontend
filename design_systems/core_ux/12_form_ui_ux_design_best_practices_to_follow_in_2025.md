### Is single-column always best?

Yes, for most cases. Single-column forms align with natural vertical scanning patterns, reduce cognitive load, and improve completion rates—except for short, related fields like “City” and “State.”

### Inline vs. on-submit validation- Which one is better?

Inline validation is better. It gives real-time feedback after field completion, helping users fix errors instantly without overwhelming them, unlike on-submit validation, which delays error discovery.

### How to mark required vs. optional fields?

Clearly mark required fields with an asterisk (*) and label optional fields explicitly as “optional” to avoid confusion and improve accessibility and user clarity throughout the form.

### Best way to handle OTP forms?

Use segmented fields with auto-advance, support pasting full codes, implement WebOTP API for mobile auto-fill, and offer a clear, retry-friendly resend code option for smoother experiences.

### Are placeholders okay as labels?

No, they disappear during input and create accessibility issues. Always use persistent labels. That’s one of the most important form UX design best practices.
