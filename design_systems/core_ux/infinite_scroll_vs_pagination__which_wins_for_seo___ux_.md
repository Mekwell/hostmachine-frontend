## FAQ’s for Pagination Vs Infinite Scroll

### What is the difference between pagination and infinite scroll in UX?

The core UX difference is controlled, deliberate navigation (pagination) vs seamless, uninterrupted consumption (infinite scroll).

### When should you use infinite scroll in UX design?

When designing content discovery-focused platforms like social feeds, image galleries, or news sites, where users are expected to explore content casually.

### What are the UX drawbacks of infinite scrolling?

Hard-to-reach footers (that contain essential business info), difficult-to-find past items, potential browser slowdowns on long pages, and potentially overloading your users with content.

### Is pagination better for SEO than infinite scroll?

Generally, yes. Pagination’s unique URLs are easier for search engines to index. Infinite scroll requires special coding to make content visible to crawlers.

### Does infinite scroll affect website performance?

Yes. Loading everything onto one page can strain browsers + cause lag/crashes, unless techniques like virtual scrolling manage the load.

### Can you combine pagination and infinite scroll in UX?

Absolutely. Hybrids like “Load More” buttons are now very common.

### Which is better for ecommerce: pagination or infinite scroll?

Pagination usually wins for core product listings. It aids in finding, comparing, and bookmarking specific items. Infinite scroll suits reviews or inspiration sections.

### How does infinite scroll impact accessibility?

It challenges screen readers and keyboard users. New content must be announced clearly, and focus managed carefully to prevent disorientation.

### What are the pros and cons of pagination in user experience design?

Pros: User control, easy item location, clear content scope, stable performance
Cons: More clicks, interrupts flow, users might miss later pages, less fluid on mobile

### How does user behavior differ between paginated and infinite scroll layouts?

Pagination users are often goal-focused. Infinite scroll users tend to explore passively.
