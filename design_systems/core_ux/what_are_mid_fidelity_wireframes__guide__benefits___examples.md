## Summary

Mid-fidelity wireframes are an upgrade from low-fidelity versions, offering clearer layouts, limited interactivity, and defined user flows to support early usability testing. They also include partial content, providing enough context for teams to understand structure and functionality.

### What is the difference between mid-fidelity and low/high-fidelity wireframes?

The difference between low, mid, and high-fidelity wireframes is their level of detail.

### How detailed should mid-fidelity wireframes be?

Mid-fidelity wireframes are more detailed than their low-fidelity counterparts but do not reach the level of high-fidelity designs. They include some colors, real text, and basic user interface elements.

### Can mid-fidelity wireframes replace prototypes?

Yes. Well-designed and clickable mid-fidelity wireframes can replace the need for creating prototypes in Agile teams.
