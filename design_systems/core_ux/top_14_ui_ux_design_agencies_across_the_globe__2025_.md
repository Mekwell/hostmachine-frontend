## Quick Summary

UI/UX design agencies use their expertise to create high-quality digital products for clients. The best agencies stand out through their design methodology, areas of specialization, client reviews, and proven portfolio of past work.

Hiring a design agency can seem like a leap of faith. Thankfully, the best UI/UX design agencies in the world are always open to questions. To decipher what value (if any) a UI/UX design agency can bring to your project: ask the following types of questions:

### What is your approach to a new project?

Design is a collaborative process. Ideally, your agency should answer this question by saying that you will be involved at every stage of the design project: from discovery to design. The agency should also clarify its expertise and mention some of its previous project outcomes.

### How much time and money will it cost?

Expect a wide-ranging answer to this question. Most UI/UX design agencies promise to deliver websites/apps three to four months into the partnership. Any agency that promises faster deliveries is probably going to miss the deadline. The best thing for clients to do is to collect multiple cost estimates from different providers and then compare them side-by-side.

### What will your agency do if we have differences of opinion?

The design process is rough. At some point (usually very early into projects) differences of opinion between clients and designers are bound to occur. Clarify the agency’s stance on this topic before you hire them. Ideally, your agency should walk you through your collective design and minimize the risk of friction.

### What previous work are you proud of?

Do not hire a UI/UX agency based on their portfolio alone. Designers often tailor their portfolios to appear as if they are perfect for addressing a client’s requirements. Instead, ask agencies to share designs they are most proud of.

### What qualities are you looking for in a client?

Determining an agency’s suitability becomes much easier when both parties are clear about their needs and motivations.
