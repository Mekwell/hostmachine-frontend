### How do I know if my website needs a redesign?

Outdated look. Outdated UX. Slow load times. Poor mobile experience. Low conversion rate. These are the most obvious signs you need a website redesign.

### How often should websites be redesigned?

Every 18-24 months.

### Will redesigning my site improve SEO?

Yes, if it’s done correctly. Redesigners must first preserve the site’s existing SEO status. Then they should improve the status by improving site speed, creating a better IA, optimizing the design for mobile, and refreshing the content.

### What's the cost of a website redesign?

Project scope. Website size. How many custom-designed features the site has. Business complexity. These factors will determine the cost. The cost will range from $5k to $100k+.

### Should I do a full redesign or just optimize my current site?

If your website only has 2-3 of the signs we’ve discussed, then targeted design optimizations will do. If it has 5+ signs, then only a full redesign will help. Get a website audit to find out which approach is right for your site.
