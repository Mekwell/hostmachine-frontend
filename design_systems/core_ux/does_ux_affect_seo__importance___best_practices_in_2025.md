## FAQs on User Experience x SEO

### Is UX a direct Google ranking factor?

Officially? No. But Core Web Vitals (loading, interactivity, stability) are, and they are UX metrics in disguise. Nail those, and Google’s page experience algos will give your site a ranking boost.

### Can you rank with poor UX?

Maybe for a day or two. But it is like building a mansion on quicksand. Backlinks might float you until users’ bail, conversions tank, and Google buries you.

### SEO content vs. UX: Who wins?

Tricky question. Killer content buried under crap navigation dies. Beautiful sites with no keywords backfire. Marry the two or fail.
