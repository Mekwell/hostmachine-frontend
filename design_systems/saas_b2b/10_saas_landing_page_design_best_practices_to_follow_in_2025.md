### What is the most important element of a SaaS landing page?

The hero section is the most important element. It must instantly communicate your unique value and feature a clear, primary CTA.

### Should SaaS landing pages show pricing?

Yes. Transparency builds trust. Hiding pricing creates friction and suspicion.

### What’s better: Free trial CTA or Demo booking CTA?

Offer both. Self-service users prefer trials. Complex or expensive products often need a demo. Let your visitor choose.

### How long should a SaaS landing page be?

A SaaS landing page should be there as long as it needs to be. Simple products need less. Complex, expensive solutions often need more copy to overcome objections and build trust.
