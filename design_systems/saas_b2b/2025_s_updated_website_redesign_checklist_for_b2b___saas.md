### What’s different in a SaaS website redesign vs a normal redesign?

A SaaS site redesign focuses on preserving complex funnels like trial signups and demo flows, not just normal webpages. These redesigns must also ensure seamless integration between the marketing site and the product.

### How do I protect SEO during a redesign?

Create a comprehensive 301 redirect map. Preserve all high-value metadata. Maintain the URL structures of top-ranking pages. Test everything on a staging site before launch.

### Which pages must never change URLs in SaaS?

The pages that should never change URLs in SaaS include pricing, trial sign-up, demo booking pages, as well as all high-traffic blog or solutions pages.

### How long does a B2B redesign take?

A B2B redesign takes 3-6 months for all phases – planning, auditing, design, development, migration, and testing

### Should SaaS sites redesign pricing pages during launch?

Yes, but with extreme caution. The pricing page is a critical conversion point. It should be extensively tested before launch.
