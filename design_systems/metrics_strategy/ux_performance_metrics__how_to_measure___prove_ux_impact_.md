Focus on activation, onboarding completion, time-to-value, feature adoption, retention cohorts, and trial-to-paid conversion. Add NPS and performance signals to capture satisfaction and reliability.

### How Often Should UX Metrics Be Reported?

Share a weekly pulse on activation and funnels, a monthly review on adoption and retention, and a quarterly strategy update that links UX uplifts to revenue and costs.
