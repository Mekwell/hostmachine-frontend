### What are the latest mobile app design trends?

Top UI/UX trends in mobile apps by 2025 will be bare-bones interface, personalization made by artificial intelligence, micro-interactiveness, dark mode, navigation via gestures, and accessible design.

### How do I know if my mobile app design is outdated?

Your mobile app design can be considered out-of-date in case it is not responsive, the layouts are chaotic, it does not consider existing UX patterns, or does not support dark mode and accessibility options.

### Why is dark mode still popular?

The Dark mode endures its popularity because of the lesser eye strain level, improved battery performance when using OLED displays, and the stylish modern appearance, which increases content on low-light background.
